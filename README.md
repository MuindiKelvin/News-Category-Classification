Given the fact that people deal with digital information, media organizations, content aggregators, and consumers must be able to categorize news articles automatically. This project involves the design and testing of a model that categorizes articles into specified categories depending on the headline and brief description. Using NLP and different classification algorithms, I intend to develop an effective and accurate news classification system. 

The dataset employed in this project contains 200,827 news headlines and belongs to 41 different categories, making the problem a multi-class one. Therefore, in this project, my goal was to create a complete machine learning pipeline ranging from data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and model evaluation to get the highest possible classification accuracy.
